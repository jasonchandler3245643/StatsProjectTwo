## Part 1: Sampling, salting, and smoothing 2 ways
1. Using native Java functions, csv files, and manual excel graphing
2. Using Octave
3. Using a Java API

## Part 2: Video Game Statistics Report
I created some textbook-inspired questions from a csv file on the 
top 100 games of each year from 2024 to 2004. I focused heavily on 
chapter 5 and therefore discrete probability and those distrubtion methods. \n
I analyzed the data by considering aspects as discrete random variables.

## Part 3: Pokemon Game on Phone
I optimized my game for mobile use using Android Studio, \n
and I ran it using a virtual machine.
