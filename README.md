# StatsProjectTwo

## Parts:
1. Part 1: Plotting, salting, smoothing 3 ways.
2. Part 2:Video Game Statistics Report 
3. Part 3:My Pokemon game phone
4. StatsLibrary 2
5. Formula Sheet

## Extra Credit Considerations:
1. Using RAWG.io, HTTP requests, and Python to access my information in part 2. \
   This took a long time, as I have very little previous experience with Python and \
   was unfamiliar with using a datbase such as Rawg. It was difficult, but \
   I feel like a much stronger programmer and know I can use this and other 
   APIs, languages, etc to accomplish tasks.
2. The information I gleaned from the csv file is relevant to the gaming indsutry and its future. \
   I feel like the information I got could me useful in a theoretical business setting. \
   I made an effort to pick something with applications. 
3. My methods to add columns in Part 1 PSS Java with and without API
   They infinetly update, allowing for as many columns as needed if not reset.
   Running the main method multiple times without resetting keeps previous information for future runs.\
4. The 2D and 3D visualizations in Part 1 Octave.
5. Documentation / Organization.

## Part 1: Sampling, salting, and smoothing 3 ways
1. Using native Java functions, csv files, and manual excel graphing
2. Using Octave
3. Using a Java APIs (JDSP and Apache POI)
