1. graphing, salting, and fixing 3 ways
2. Report on video game data from 2024 - 2004
3. My Pokemon game on my phone
4. StatsLibrary 2
5. Formula Sheet


## Part 1: Sampling, salting, and smoothing 3 ways
1. Using native Java functions, csv files, and manual excel graphing
2. Using Octave
3. Using a Java APIs (JDSP and Apache POI)

## Part 2: Video Game Statistics Report
I created some textbook-inspired questions from a csv file on the 
top 100 games of each year from 2024 to 2004. I focused heavily on 
chapter 5 and therefore discrete probability and those distrubtion methods. \
I analyzed the data by considering aspects as discrete random variables.

## Part 3: Pokemon Game on Phone
I optimized my game for mobile use using Android Studio, \
and I ran it using a virtual machine.

## StatsLibrary 2
Java programs of relevant formulas from the second hald of the semester. \
