# StatsProjectTwo

## Parts:
1. Part 1: Plotting, salting, smoothing 3 ways.
2. Part 2: Video Game Statistics Report 
3. Part 3: My Pokemon game phone
4. StatsLibrary 2
5. Formula Sheet

## Extra Credit Considerations:
1. Using RAWG.io, HTTP requests, and Python to access my information in part 2. \
   This took a long time, as I have very little previous experience with Python and \
   was unfamiliar with using a datbase such as RAWG. It was difficult, but \
   I feel like a much stronger programmer and know I can use this and other. 
   APIs, languages, etc to accomplish tasks. Working with the file that \
   took so long to get was rewarding.
3. The relevance of the data I obtained and analyzed \
   I made a conscious effort to get information that both interests me \
   and that could be useful in a theoretical business setting. \
   I made an effort to focus on trends that could impact business aspects \
   like esrb rating, genres, and scores used to judge games.
4. The Java program I made alongside my report and its sample questions \
   I made sure all the percentages and counts used in my data were accurate \
   and tested 
5. My methods to add columns in Part 1 PSS Java with and without API \
   They infinetly update, allowing for as many columns as needed if not reset. \
   Running the main method multiple times without resetting keeps previous information for future runs.
6. The 2D and 3D visualizations in Part 1 Octave.
7. I taught myself some basic Maven and dependencies information for my APIs in part 1. \
    I graphed my data in Project 1 and added the jars manually just to still get an error \
   in my final output. I avoided that at all costs here by swapping to Maven.
8. Documentation / Organization. \
   My Java files are all javadoc'd, and I organized my project and its components well.

## Part 1: Sampling, salting, and smoothing 3 ways
1. Using native Java functions, csv files, and manual excel graphing
2. Using Octave
3. Using a Java APIs (JDSP and Apache POI)

## Part 2: Video Game Statistics Report
My Video Game Statstics Report \
The retreival and analysis of a csv file containing \
information about the 40 most popular games 2024 - 2004

## Part 3: Pokemon Game on Phone
I ran my Pokemon game on my iPhone using jDoodle.

## StatsLibrary 2
Java programs of relevant formulas from the second hald of the semester. 

## Formula Sheet 2
Formulas from the second half of the semester organized.
