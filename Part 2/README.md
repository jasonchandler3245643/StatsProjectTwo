3. video game data.csv: The csv file of my data set
4. getDataPlease.py: The Python script I used to obtain
5. Video Game Stats Report Excel.xlsx: The Excel file used to visualize

## Key takeaways:
1. The textbook questions models real life
2. There are many ways to approach analyzing data \
   visualization and the textbook question methods provided valuable insight.
3. ESRB ratings are much more varied than I would have thought \
    I assumed to make a game more marketable, developers would abstain from \
    Mature or Adults Only. That was not the case, these more mature values occupied \
    most of the top games
4. Multiplayer games are beatifully 50% \
    A really cool thing piece of informations is that 50%, \
    420 / 840 games, are multiplayer. This was the last data slot \
    I added to the file, so I am happy it has an interesting value.
5. Genre trends are unique
    The games are mostly Shooter and Adventure genres. \
    Of the dominant Shooter genre, most of them are multiplayer, \
    and about 1/3 of total multiplayer games are shooters.
