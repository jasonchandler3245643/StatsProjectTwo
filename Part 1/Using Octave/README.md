I used Octave to accomplish the same goal. \
It was much easier. Instead of making any methods or objects, \
I made a simple vector for inputs of 0 - 1000. \
Then, I made another vector by setting it equal to my equation using the simple vector. \
I salted the data by creating a new vector of the same size filled with random numbers and added it to y. \
I smoothed the data using Octaves native ____ function. \
\
Finally, I plotted the original, salted, and 3 runs of smoothing on the same graph. \
This took less than 50 lines of code, whereas using Java without an API took close to ____. \
lines plus manually graphing it.
