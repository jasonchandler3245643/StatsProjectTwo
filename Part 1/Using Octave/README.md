Octave plotting, salting, and smoothing was so much simpler than Java. \
Java was not difficult, but it took a while despite all my experience with it. \
Octave was really simple to pick up and get right to graping basic functions. \

## What I learned:
1. Other languages may be more effective at something
2. I have the tools to find such languages and learn to use them
3. New programming language Octave that I wish I knew of before. It would have helped greatly for some old assignemnts.
