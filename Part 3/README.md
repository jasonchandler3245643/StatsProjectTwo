## Summary
I made my Pokemon compatabile with most Android devices. \
I used Android Studio to code and to test my code on a virtual machine. \
\
To set up the VM, I had to enable Hypervision in my PC's BIOS and enable it in \
windows features. Then, I had to download is in the Android Studio SDK Manager. \
Finally, I ran the VM and optimized my code for it. \
\
I optimzied my code primarily by exchanging my System.out.print statements for \
Toast.makeText(context, "TEXT", lengthOfDisplay). This allowed me to \
send messages much like regular Java. \
I also made sure to edit some Kotlin projects. I kept my "main" method\ 
in Java but used Kotlin for formatting and aeshtetics. I used it to \
differentiate it from my Java console version and get more familiar with \
Android app programming and another programming language. \
